# Intelligent-Mannequin

This project uses Haar Cascade and OpenCV to detect a face in a live user feed and once a face is detected it asks a predefined set of questions using Google text to speech (GTTS) and records the replies given by the user in a database.

It also sends an email to the user based on the most recent feedback entry into the database.
